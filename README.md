# React Project - Making of Calculator(Math Magician App) - Functioning of the Calculator Events


> The following features are incorporated in this branch of the project :

- The layout of a calculator is incorporated.
- Git flow is used.
- Class-based components are created.
- The files "calculate.js" and "operate.js" is copied into a directory named "logic".
- Inside "components" a new "Calculator.js" and "Calculator.css" file is created.
- In "Calculator.js", a React component that matches the design of the Calculator is created.
- The files "calculate.js" and "operate.js" will do the necessary mathematical operations ("big.js" is added as dependency).
- The event handlers are implemented so that the math logic from "calculate.js" and "operate.js" work in the React component.
- A full website for the Math magicians app is created consists of different pages and using the components.  For every page, a route is created.
